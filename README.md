# Simple-FTP-Application
A Java application by which files can be transferred among server and client devices.
There are two different versions- Server and Client (there are two different main classes for those)

Client application:
1. can connect to a server
2. can upload to and download from the server
3. can pause/resume on the fly
4. can browse the client's hard disk
5. anonymous

Server application:
1. can manage connecting with multiple clients and their file transfers
2. share the contents of a specific folder of the server computer

Limitations:
1. only anonymous clients
2. problem with file permissions
3. design not very efficient
